<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a communication and project management professional passionate about turning ideas into tangible 
  results. Throughout my career, I have learned that organization, empathy, and clarity are the foundation 
  of meaningful progress. For me, every project is like a summit to be reached step by step, with 
  perseverance, focus, and teamwork</p>

<p>I have worked in international and multicultural environments, coordinating communication, marketing, 
  and technology projects. My experience at global companies such as the Coca-Cola group taught me how 
  to balance creativity with structure and maintain clear communication across teams with different 
  perspectives and priorities.</p>

<p>In recent years, I have focused on projects that combine strategy, automation, and content. I am 
  particularly interested in how technology — from agile methodologies to artificial intelligence — can 
  improve processes, enhance collaboration, and optimize the way we communicate.</p>

<p>I am known for staying calm under pressure, keeping a global perspective, and finding practical 
  solutions. A native Spanish speaker with strong command of German and English, I thrive in diverse 
  teams and enjoy building connections that lead to solid and impactful projects.</p>
